Welcome to my homepage,
I am Yan Lu and a Computer Science Ph.D. student at New York University advised by [Sam Bowman](http://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/). Iâ€™m interested in edge intelligence. Prior to NYU, I got M.Tech from Purdue University and B.Tech from Sichuan University.

# Research Interests

### Intelligent Video Analytics
======
Deploying deep models on real-world videos bring many challenges on system and machine learning because deep learning needs a large resource (memory and computation) to process and traditional ML assumes the distribution of all data is i.i.d (independent and identically distributed). But the two assumptions on the real-world system are not satisfied.

### Edge Computing and Virtualization
======
Traditional CS (client and server) architecture is not suitable for the AI application because of large latency processing data and transmission. Thus, how to develop a new efficient framework for AI-related application to combine cloud and client is an interesting problem in edge computing. Besides, developing a new virtualization architecture to trade off the performance and latency on devices is also a promising problem because of heterogeneous resources for computation and storage.
